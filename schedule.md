# Spring 2019

The current plan is to initiate the Gaussian process (GP) reading group in 
spring of 2019 with weekly meetings that would be broken up into blocks of about 4 sessions with a 
consistent topic. Thus, over the course of the 15-16 weeks of the spring semester there will be
time for 4 topics.

## Meeting dates

__TO BE DETERMINED__.

## Outline

Some possible topics are (1) Fundamentals, (2) Applications, (3) Computation/Big Data.

__Fundamentals__. Fundamentals would include the basics of Gaussian processes including 
multivariate normal theory, covariance functions, parameter estimation, 
and prediction (interpolation/extrapolation).

__Applications__ GPs have a wide variety of applications including spatial statistics, 
non-linear/non-parametric regression, and computer experiments.

__Computation__. While GPs have nice properties both parameter estimation and prediction, they require
traces and inverses of matrices whose size are on the order of the data. Thus many methods have been developed to reduce computation time which, typically, rely on approximations. Therefore, there is typically a trade-off between computational complexity and fidelity to the model.

The following is the tentative outline along with the name in charge of leading the topic.

- Weeks 1-2: Intro to GP. Nate/Luis.
- Weeks 3-4: Applications on regression and/or time series. Focus on the 1d-input case. Nate/Luis.
- Weeks 5-6: Applications on spatial data. Focus on the 2d-input case. Mattern function. Jarad.
- Weeks 7-8: Applications on multiple regression. Focus on the +2d-input case. Jarad.
- Weeks 9-10: Applications on computer experiments. Gulzina.
- Weeks 11-12: Applications on classification. Focus on the binary case. Gulzina.
- Weeks 13-14: Applications on point processes. Nate.
- Weeks 15-16: GP for big data. Focus on approximations due to computational complexity. Luis.

Please, add the outline below following the template. Give a one-sentence description on the content of the session. Include a link if publicly available. You may list more than one reading if you are still undecided but please make your best to decide on it :).
