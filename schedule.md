# Schedule

The current plan is to initiate the Gaussian process (GP) reading group in 
spring of 2019 with weekly meetings.
The weekly meetings will be broken up into groups of ~4 meetings with a 
consistent topic.
Thus, over the course of the 15-16 weeks of the spring semester there will be
time for 4 topics.

## Topics

Some possible topics are Fundamentals, Applications, Computation/Big Data.

Fundamentals would include the basics of Gaussian processes including 
multivariate normal theory, covariance functions, parameter estimation, 
and prediction (interpolation/extrapolation).

GPs have a wide variety of applications including spatial statistics, 
non-linear/non-parametric regression, and computer experiments. 
We could run a month on ``applications'' highlighting the use of GPs in each
of these domains or we could choose a domain and read into that particular 
application.

While GPs have nice properties both parameter estimation and prediction require
traces and inverses of matrices whose size are on the order of the data.
Thus many methods have been developed to reduce computation time which, typically,
requires approximations of the GP.
Therefore, there is typically a trade-off between computational complexity and
fidelity to the model.
